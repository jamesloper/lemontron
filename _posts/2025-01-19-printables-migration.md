Bambu has been toying with us hobbyists for a few days now, and it's time to set the record straight. Bambu is
currently doing a rug-pull and lying about its intentions.

Bambu thinks they're sly but they're not; Lemontron has migrated off Bambu's platform
to [Printables]({{site.download_link}}), and it should have been that way from the start.

**Please take a moment to Like, Follow, Bookmark, and Download on the Printables platform!**

If you're wondering why Lemontron was even on MakerWorld to begin with, well it's because Bambu promoted it with my
printer and I fell for it. I will not be accepting a sponsorship from Bambu.

From now on I will be doing my official releases through a platform that deserves our trust-- Printables by Prusa!
