The MicroProbe V2.0 is an ABL sensor, meaning it is used to automatically detect and compensate for tilt in the build
surface. This helps ensure that the first layer of a print is laid down
perfectly, which is crucial for print adhesion and overall print quality.

## Accuracy

- 0.001mm Standard Deviation @24℃ Ambient, 60℃ Bed
- 0.003mm Standard Deviation @60℃ Ambient, 100℃ Bed

## Required Modification

You need to chamfer the bottom of the probe so that you can use the two M2.5 countersink screws. It really is that
compact that it requires shaving a literal millimeter.
