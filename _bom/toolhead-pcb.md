This simple little breakout board enhances the fun of assembling the Lemontron Tool Head. This board sits on the
aluminum heat sink and provides pads to solder each component to. You can always build a Lemontron Tool Head without it,
but manual wire management in such a small area can be frustrating.

Optimal thickness is 1mm, the thickness is definitely not critical.

Designed by Sample Name & Lemontron.

On the previous version (v1.2) the silkscreen had a mistake. The HEF and PCF labels are swapped. The EXT pads should
read (top to bottom) PCF, TH+, HEF. This is fixed in v1.3!
