GT2 refers to the type of tooth profile on the belt. GT2 belts have a rounded tooth profile. This type of profile
minimizes backlash (the slight movement in a system when the direction is reversed). The 3mm width is uncommon, which is
why you'll typically see these 3mm belts from small manufacturers.

The 1.9m length is a little more than needed.
