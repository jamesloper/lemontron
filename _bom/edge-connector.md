The edge connector is a 2x3 6 pin, straight connector. It is used to electrically connect the edge of the heat bed to
the SKR PICO.

The LCSC one is used by Voxolite and LDO, but I've not had any issues with the AliExpress one. Parts other than these are known to be less wide
and require filing the PCB edge to fit.
